    DR. HERDAL.
<br>
Is he not coming soon?
<br>
</br>
MRS. SOLNESS.
<br>
Yes, I think so. I have sent for him at any rate.
<br>
</br>
DR. HERDAL.
<br>
[Advancing.] I am afraid you will have to go in, my dear lady--
<br>
</br>
MRS. SOLNESS.
<br>
Oh no! Oh no! I shall stay out here and wait for Halvard.
<br>
</br>
DR. HERDAL.
<br>
But some ladies have just come to call on you--
<br>
</br>
MRS. SOLNESS.
<br>
Good heavens, that too! And just at this moment!
<br>
</br>
DR. HERDAL.
<br>
They say they positively must see the ceremony.
